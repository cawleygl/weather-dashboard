## Description of Application
This application is a weather dashboard that shows weather conditions in multiple cities. It uses the OpenWeather API to collect data on the current weather and 5-day forecasts for any city, and uses Materialize CSS framework for styling. Users can type a city's name in the search bar, and when the submit button is clicked, they will be shown the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and color-coded UV Index for the location they chose, along with a 5-day forecast. Icons also display current and future weather conditions. The city's name will also be displayed in a button in the search history on the left-hand side of the page. If the user clicks one of these buttons, they will be shown that city's information again. This is so they can enter multiple cities to compare their weather information quickly. Also, upon refresh, the search history and current displayed city will be saved using local storage and maintained on the page.

## Technologies Used
